        <p>We all have <em>dreams</em>, some of us carry it out, other who look into the
        facts...  Even though <em>beauty</em> is simply an ornament, its
        contemplation can bring us joy.  Witness <em>beauty</em> in you and others
        too. What may seem may not be what it is. Distort your <em>reality</em> with
        <em>imagination</em> and then disregard your consciousness, your mind can't
        take it apart!</p>

        <p>Organized is better than chaos, but Organizing is the chaos!<br>
        Are you acting like possessed, or have abandoned chase.<br>
        Game is on, its set, there is the limit, what you can face,<br>
        will you compromise, or will it break...</p>
