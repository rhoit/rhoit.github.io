After learning about *gh-pages*, I came to learn about *static
web-page generator*, awesome *git* and *hosting* in same place *wow*
thanks to *github*.

* It Begins

  Finally, decided now I should write the *blog*, +itsn't that+ I
  have'nt never tried +earlier+, it was never satisfing or it was my
  *incompetence*. Web was ~never my thing~, unlike system affiars, I
  had grating experiences. Its has +not+ been long, since I have left
  the world of *word processors* and ~WYSIWYG~ and +never looked
  back+. If you are thinking *Google Docs* then ~you are wrong~. Being
  brought up with *snail modem*, you just want every thing on your
  *localhost*. It was +the best+ solution but something I forced on
  +myself+ to learn during my undergrad years *LateX*.

  *LateX*, I absolutly +love+ it, +cool+ isn't it, now you can complie
   your documents like your *code*! Then, everything changed when
   *automatic README.md generator* attacked. Only the *emacs* "the
   master of the text editors" could stop them. When the world needed
   the *mode* it vanished. 100 week passed, Me and [[https://github.com/zerOnepal][@zerOnepal]] found
   the new *repo* called *org-js*. And, although its rendering skill
   were great, it needs lot to patched before it could be used. But I
   believe *org-js* can save the world.

   I had the +good+ experience with *wordpress*, even before I began
   *emacs*, +I knew it sucked+. *e-Blogger* I did write +few+ posts
   but I was uuhh.. Guess what I'm more +comforable+ with plain html
   than its *fractious* editors. Then the *gh-pages* arrived.. Yet
   again, Finally, decided now I should write the *blog*. Ok lets rite
   it in *md*. I started typing few lines, then like the +visonary+ I
   thought aheadâ€¦

   : It would be too hard to manage all this pages.

*THIS IS THE SAMPLE BLOG*
