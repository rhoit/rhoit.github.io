#+STARTUP: showall

It was year *2012-2013* I got my hand on *3D-model* data of
*University*, and the idea popped up.. /Why not we play *games* on
it?/, *NFS*, *CS*... only problem was map was in =GIS=. Looking back
now *games* I +wrote+ till date only runs on [[https://github.com/rhoit/2048][terminal]], is definitely a
+good+ start, but when I'm done it would be *awesome*.

* le get package

  Back, then I tried installing =grass gis= on *archlinux*. Scene was
  not pretty then, lets see what happens this time, This time I had to
  get this =qgis= thing before,

  : $ yaourt qgis
  : 1 aur/horao-git 0-2 (3)
  :     Oslandia's 3D visualisation stack with QGIS plugin

  Its taking too much time, *STOP* it. There must be better way to do
  this. There is and I know it! :D

** Bridge Over shallow waters

   One doesn't need the *history* of /development/ for getting latest
   version of software. This might save you someday, Since

   [[shallow.jpeg]]

   #+begin_quote
   I haven't found the =git clone= resume mechanism just yet.
   #+end_quote

   : $ git clone git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git --bare --depth=1

   : remote: Counting objects: 11162, done.

   : Checking connectivity... done.

   Much better now, but still need to make =yaourt= get the /bare
   repository/. This requires configuration your *yaourtrc* file,
   change the following variable. See *yaourtrc* manual for details,
   move your /repo/ into.

   #+begin_src bash
     DEVEL = 1
     DEVELSRCDIR = /path/to/yaourt/devel/directory
   #+end_src

   Once again restarting build from *yaourt*, now we don't have to
   _download_ the *git history*.

   Compilation took almost _60 mins_, then while packaging it failed!

   : install: cannot stat ‘/path/to/yaourt-tmp/aur-qgis-git/pkg/qgis-git/opt/qgis-git/bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi’: No such file or directory
   : ==> ERROR: A failure occurred in package().
   :     Aborting...
   : ==> ERROR: Makepkg was unable to build qgis-git.
   : ==> Restart building qgis-git ? [y/N]
   : ==> ---------------------------------
   : ==>

   It was the close call since the *error* was not raised by the
   =built()= process, imagine trying to fix it by *hit and trail* with
   built time like that.

* Under the hood

  At this point of time, its too *risky* to run *yaourt* /again/ since
  it wipes everything and starts from scratch and the compiled output
  would be lost forever but problem was where the heck is that file
  what cause this mayhem in the first place.

  : $ cd /path/to/yaourt-tmp/aur-qgis-git/
  : $ find -iname "*qgis_mapserv.fcgi*"

  and culprit was no where to be found.

** where is my engine

   Yet again, the *AUR* was unpredictable, when you read the *PKGFILE*
   you can find the frustration of the maintainer here and there.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   install -Dm755 $pkgdir/opt/$pkgname/bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi \
     $pkgdir/usr/bin/qgis_mapserv_git.fcgi

   # TODO: these aren't working for some reason, ie, .qgs files are not opened by QGIS...
   # Appears to be a conflict with some file types being defaulted to google-chrome/chromium if that's installed as well.
   #install -dm755 "$pkgdir/usr/share/pixmaps" \
   #  "$pkgdir/usr/share/mimelnk/application"

   #+END_EXAMPLE

   it seemed to work without few components

   [[dash.jpeg]]

   : $ cd /path/to/yaourt-tmp/aur-qgis-git/src/qgis/build/output/bin
   : $ ls
   : crssync  qbrowser  qgis  qgisbuildpath.txt

   there it was, =qgis=.

   [[check.jpeg]]

** bypass

   Since, the built was already over I commented the =built()= section
   and let =makepkg= do it magic after few minutes it was ready.

* FAQ

  - Is the game out?

    I'm still trying to find *3D-model* data, its lost somewhere.
