#+TITLE: Let's Blog +Again+
#+DESCRIPTION: blog post #001, published Monday, Aug 17 2015
#+DATE: Saturday Jan 17 2015

#+STARTUP: showall
#+OPTIONS: num:t toc:0

After learning about *gh-pages*, from *github*, I came to learn about
*static web-page generator*. This is the story of procrastination,
where I decided to create a site. +Strangely+ my first blog, published
7 months late, explain how all started after all.

* It Begins

  Finally, decided "Now I should write the *blog*", +itsn't that+ I
  haven't never tried +earlier+, it was never satisfying or it was my
  *incompetence*. Just that web was ~never my thing~. Being brought up
  with *snail modem*, you develop the phobia and just want every thing
  on your *localhost*.

  During my undergrad years I forced on +myself+ to learn *LateX*,
  they said I was +cool+, now you can compile your documents like your
  *code*! Then, everything changed when *README.md renderer*
  attacked. Only the *emacs* "the master of the text editors" could
  stop them. When the world needed the *mode* it vanished. 100 week
  passed, Me and [[https://github.com/zerOnepal][@zerOnepal]] found the new *repo* called *org-js*. And,
  although its _pre-ndering_ skill were great, it needs lot to patched
  before it could be used. But I believe *org-js* can save the blog.

** Static Site Generators

   I started typing few lines, thought ahead â€¦ It would be too hard to
   manage all this pages, then found about *static web-page
   generator*. Here are few of them I tried.

*** jekyll

    Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. Which
    was Simple, Static, Blog-aware, so it said but I remember my time
    with ruby gems! then I had the other thoughts. Few months later I
    found something called *Octopress* jekyll framework. It said
    framework for hacker, but I wasn't one to figure it out.  But, I
    did find *Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde* and end up watching few episodes
    of ..

*** Python

    [[https://wiki.python.org/moin/StaticSiteGenerator][python-wiki]] had lots of them, which should I try first?

* Enough, enough is Enough

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Stop! Stop it, before I start hating everything.
  #+END_QUOTE

  Then, As the +good+ programmer, jotted down what I wanted aka *requirements*.
    - uses thing i know
    - minimum learning
    - not too much installation
    - markup support

  Then again in my head...

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    What, if I make my own *static page generator*?

    In what language? *python*, hmm... no

    *bash*, I should do it *bash*!
  #+END_QUOTE

  The the +smart+ brain said someone might have already done it. And,
  it was rite. After few mins of googling, [[https://www.staticgen.com/]]
  popped up. /A leaderboard of the top open-source static site
  generators/.


** Ok Wait!

   These all generators are great but they only support *Markdown*, It
   has been a while I have been writing on *org-mode*.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Hey can *Org-mode* do that?
   #+END_QUOTE

   It been +long+ I haven't over-engineered. Thought of doing it with
   *emacs* then checked my requirement list.

    - [X] uses thing i know
    - [X] minimum learning
    - [ ] not too much installation
    - [X] markup support

   Then began coding the generator ... which will be *beautiful*,
   *elegant* and *sleek*... until [[https://github.com/zerOnepal][@zerOnepal]] was back again!

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Hey check this out [[https://github.com/mooz/org-js/][org-js]] which does directly renders the stuff into
   HTML!
   #+END_QUOTE

** Design

   Template confuses me rather than help me, back in days I had wrote
   fair share of css, just that it was long time ago, I couldn't
   remember a thing. One way or another I had to start, many time I
   had been told to use the twitter *bootstrap*. When I did *myTheme*
   with 100 lines of css disappeared into nothingness..  and .. few
   moments later .. /scroll/, /scrOll/, /SCROLL/, =Ctrl + C= and
   =Ctrl + V=.  Let's say that day *I got lots of inspiration*!

** Mozrepl

   One of the chief reason, I didn't like web-development was just
   because it didn't have *Makefile*! I have switching constantly with
   editor and browser with streams =F5= made me irritated, which means

   - [X] make changes
   - [X] Save
   - [ ] Switch to Browser
   - [ ] Refresh
   - [ ] Switch to Editor

   Which is strongly felt last 3 could be avoided. Luckily I found
   youtube channel *emacs rocks* where they showed live markdown
   render which has always eluded me with the possibility. Not long
   after that it was =el-get-install<RET>moz-repl<RET>=.

** Nikola

   Nicola http://getnikola.com/ was something I found some time later
   after starting the static-gen project, Then the *Question* was
   should i _abandon_ my project? org-mode is supported. Although it
   halted me for few months, but *org-js*, was just too good.

* Rebounce!

  In the process to create the site, I did the thing with I despised
  earlier something I have never tried...

** bootstrap & jekyll

   Ok let check it out what this jekyll it was I hold my girt, kick my
   block head.. any way *bootstrap* uses it....

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     $ gem install jekyll
     ...
     ..
     $ cd /path/to/bootstrap
     $ jekyll serve
     Configuration file: /path/to/bootstrap/_config.yml
                 Source: docs
            Destination: _gh_pages
           Generating...
                         done.
      Auto-regeneration: enabled for 'docs'
     Configuration file: /path/to/bootstrap/_config.yml
         Server address: http://0.0.0.0:9001/
       Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
   #+END_SRC


** Redesign

   Months passed, I hadn't touch the project, Since, I made the
   initial design, started writing some stuff since I need some
   content.I made some samples and edited images, and was stuck with
   some issue, which I couldn't solve.

* Reboot

  Something intresting happend, I went on to talk at *py-dev meet*,
  and organizer asked me to put the slides up. But, problem was there
  wasn't I gave that on *emacs* with *org-mode*. I was too lazy when
  to make one and old dusty projects was just lying in place. Somehow
  magically it was all done in 2-3 hrs, and it look like [[../../talks/pydev7][this]].

** bloglob

   Ok, I saw the Calendar again, this year is going to end soon, a
   hectic year with earthquake after all. Although for generator to
   work, I need the content, for my content I need generator. Then I
   just *Let it go*!
